# This Month In History - a project that brought together everything I had been learning about api's. 
I chose to work with the NYT's Search Aricle API, with the purpose of searching their archive.

Screenshots

## This Month In History allows you to search the New York Time's archive, dating from September 1851 to present.
The results are filtered by having the user choose a month, year, and a U.S. state.

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Jquery was used for this app.
