### nyt-search-api - a project that brought together everything I had been learning about APIs.

I chose to work with the NYT's Search Aricle API, with the purpose of searching their archive.

### nyt-search-api allows you to search the New York Time's archive, dating from September 1851 to present.
The results are filtered by having the user choose a month, year, and a U.S. state.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Jquery was used for this app.
